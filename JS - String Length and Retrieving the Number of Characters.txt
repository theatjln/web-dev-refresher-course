String Length and Retrieving the Number of Characters

length
- the property of a string that will help us know how many characters in a string
- e.g.
var word = "hi"
word.length ---> result: 2

Exercise: 
Write a JS code to:
- TODO 1: create prompt where the user can enter a long string (e.g. a paragraph of text from a blog post)
- TODO 2: you will tell them how many characters they have written
- TODO 3: how many characters they have remaining out of 140 or 280 characters
- TODO 4: show an output of "You have returned 182 characters, you have -42 (140 - 182 characters left

My answer:
var textInput = prompt("Enter your blog post here: ")

alert("You have returned " + textInput.length + ", you have " + (140 - textInput.length) + " left.")
