Bootstrap layout

12 Column systems:
- first, we need a div.container
- next, div.row which are the row items in the container
- then, div.col which are the column items in the container

e.g.
 <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">Hello</div>
    </div>
</div>


Bootstrap Container (which are responsive)
.container
.container-sm 
.container-md 
.container-lg 
.container-xl 
.container-xxl 
.container-fluid

Bootstrap Breakpoints
reference: 
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/breakpoints/
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/containers/

e.g. 
col-sm: when the screen width is less than 540px, the col-sm and col-sm- will distribute of occupy the entire width of the screen


Multiple Breakpoints
- in a single div, you can have multiple breakpoints

e.g. for col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-4
===col-lg-4
on large screens, would take up 4 columns of the width

===col-md-8 
on medium devices, would take up 8 columns of the width

===col-sm-12
on small devices, would take up 12 columns of the width
