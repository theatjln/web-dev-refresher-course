1. position: static; //default position of all elements

2. position: relative; //the element will be relative to the position to it's own default position 

3. position: absolute; //the element will be absolute to it's ancestor element which has a "position: relative"; 

if there's no ancestor with "position: relative;", the element with "position: absolute;" will follow the screen as ancestor.

when you set an element with "position: absolute;", you take it out from the HTML original flow and puts it on another layer. So, using "z-index: 0;" might just not work.

4. position: fixed; // relative to the top left corner of the browser window;

even if you scroll up and down, it will remain to it's position
