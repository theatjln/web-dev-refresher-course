JavaScript Alerts - Adding Behavior to Websites

- JS "alert()" needs "CTRL + Shift" to execute multiline of code
    - solution: use Snippets
        - how: go to "Developer Tools" > "Sources" > ">>" > Snippets > Create a new snippet file (e.g. index.js) >
        - enter your code in the new snippet file
        - hit "CTRL + Enter" to run it

- in "alert("Hello");" :
the syntax says:
--alert is the function that pop ups something on the browser
--Hello is the string
--; is the end
