Color Theory
- is the art and science of creating the right palette for your website


Mood
- when you're picking colors, you have to be of the MOOD of the color palette

- the dominant color in your design really tells a story and it conveys a message to the user

e.g.
===RED:
- conveys LOVE, ENERGY, and INTENSITY


===YELLOW:
- conveys JOY, INTELLECT, and ATTENTION
- the most important about YELLOW is how attention grabbing it is
- (beware, DON'T) when you're creating something that's designed to be looked at for a long period of time, then, yellow can be too attention-grabbing. It might actually hurt your user's eye if you try to read whole article that's background is yellow


===GREEN:
- conveys FRESHNESS, SAFETY, and GROWTH
- safest color if a company is about FOOD


===BLUE:
- conveys STABILITY, TRUST, and SERENITY
- usually banking companies use this color to indicate that they are not running away with your money
- e.g. on an interview, if you choose to wear blue, you vastly increase the amount of trust in you that's given by other people


===PURPLE:
- conveys ROYALTY, WEALTH, and FEMINITY

----------------------------------------------------------------
You're making a conscious decision when you're choosing a color palette.
It's not just picking a color you like or your favorite color. 
But it's actually what message am I trying to convey to the user.
And then, picking an appropriate color

COMBINING COLORS

Color Wheel ( reference: https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/ )

Very often, designers will rely on scientific ways of combining colors

===ANALOGOUS COLORS
- two colors sitting next to each other in the color wheel
- looks incredibly harmonious really work well together
- good for:
    - NAVIGATION/NAVBARS and the BODY of your website
    - LOGO and BACKGROUND
-not good for standing out


===COMPLEMENTARY COLORS (or CLASHING PALETTE)
- two colors sitting exactly opposite to each other
- use this if you really want your design to pop or stand out
- brings out each of the colors
- e.g. 
    - in supermarket, they often use fake grasses/green with the meat
- (DON'T) use for texts with background (very jarring) 
- keep it to things like LOGOS or ICONS


- Other Color Palettes
===TRIADIC color palettes
===TETRADIC color palettes (by drawing a perfect square)
