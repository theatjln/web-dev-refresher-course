Bootstrap Framework
- open source

- an external layout systems

- type of CSS framework

- contained pre-made CSS files which you can simply include into your projects in order to use their pre-built components and styling by adding their styles

- has 12 column layout systems built out of flexbox


// Two most popular external CSS Frameworks are:
1. Bootstrap
2. Foundation

Others
3. MUI
4. Tailwind


We actually don't need to know these Frameworks but using External CSS Frameworks has PROS:
- Easy and fast to use
- you get a ton of pre-built components
- you have good browsing compatibility because they've tested all the different browsers (e.g. Safari, Chrome, Brave, etc.)


CONS/DOWNSIDES:
- class bloat (it's really good to separate structure from style)
- customization 
    - customizing their pre-built components and layouts could be hard
    - if you want to build a website where you have full control over every pixel and layout and everything to be exactly the way you design it, External CSS is not a way to go
