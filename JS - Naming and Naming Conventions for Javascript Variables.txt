Naming and Naming Conventions for Javascript Variables

How you should name your variables to follow the best practices for naming conventions:

1. Give your variables meaningful names
- so that anybody can figure out quite easily what is the data that's likely to be stored inside it.


2. You can't use keywords as name of your variables (e.g. var --- error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token var)

but you can use variables that contains keywords as (e.g. myVar)


3. Variable name cannot begin with a number:
e.g. var 1234 = 1234 --- error


4. Variable name contain spaces in between:
e.g. my name = "Nica" --- error


5. Variable names can only contain letters numbers, "$", and "_"; no other symbols are valid characters


6. use camelCasing
