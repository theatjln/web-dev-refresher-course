Flex Sizing
- how to size the flex-items: shrinking, growing, and how to behave when it's in a responsive situation



How to customize flex-items size in a flex-box is using a priority list:

Content width < Width < flex-basis < min-width/max-width



flex-grow: 0; //default, to turn off, set value to 0
flex-shrink: 1; //default, to turn off, set value to 0
flex-basis: auto; //default, to turn off, set value to 0 



flex-grow: 1; 
flex-shrink: 1; 
flex-basis: 0;  
===shorthand -> flex: 1 1 0; or flex: 1;



example:
this will show a ratio on how each dive will glow and shrink equally on a screen:

.flex-container {
    display: flex;
    gap: 10px;
}

.flex-item .red {
    flex: 1;
}

.flex-item .blue {
    flex: 2;
}

.flex-item .green {
    flex; 3;
}



-- shrinking and growing

 
-- all elements inside a flex box is called - flex items


-- how flex-items sizing are applied based on these attributes for hierarchy:
===Content width < width < flex-basis < min-width/max-width


- max-width means the whole width of the content
- min-width means the width of the longest one word in the content

- width is the width set for the items inside the flex box

- flex-basis is also the width set for the flex-


examples:
.flex-container {
    display: flex;
    gap: 10px;
}


if this is defined:
.flex-items{
    flex-basis: 200px;
    min-width: 300px;
}

-- the min-width will be followed;
-- and when we shrink a flex-box with items having flex-basis and min-width, it's not going to shrink less than the min-width 



if this is defined:
.flex-items{
    flex-basis: 100px;
    flex-grow: 0;
    flex-shrink: 0;
} 

-- items don't change their width at all because it can't grow and it can't shrink



if this is defined:
.flex-items{
    flex-basis: 100px;
    flex-grow: 1;
    flex-shrink: 0;
} 
-- items will stretch to fill 1 part of the width of the container
-- when shrinked, they won't go any smaller than 100px;
-- thus, it means they can grow more than 100px but can't shrink less than 100px;
-- it won't shrink but it will grow;



if this is defined:
.flex-items{
    flex-basis: 100px;
    flex-grow: 0;
    flex-shrink: 1;
}   

-- thus, it means they can shrink from 100px upto the min-width of the content of a flex-item, but can't grow more than 100px;
-- it won't grow, but it will shrink



if this is defined:
.flex-items{
    flex-basis: 100px;
    flex-grow: 1;
    flex-shrink: 1;
}   

-- it means, flex-basis is totally ignored
-- flex items can grow or shrink to any size



flex-basis: auto; // default, it gives more flex-basis to the items which has more content
flex-basis: 0; // ignores the default and let the flex items have equal width


shorthand:
flex: [grow] [shrink] [basis]
flex: 1 1 0

shortesthand:
flex: 1
