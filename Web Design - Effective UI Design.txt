User Interface (UI) Design

Manage ATTENTION with effective User Interface (UI) Design
(H.L.A.W.A)
(H.ierarchy--L.ayout--A.lignment--W.hitespace--A.udience)


1. HIERARCHY
- we're always drawn to the bigger, bolder, and squarer things
    - as designers, we can use this knowledge to define hierarchy

Ways to use HIERARCHY:
- in COLOR
    - e.g. ecommerce website with gray and white palette, but when it comes to "Add to Cart" and "Locations" buttons, they purposely made it Red and Green

- in SIZE
    - The bigger items draws eyes to it
    - e.g. coinbase website ( https://www.coinbase.com/ ), the heading is the biggest ("The future of money is here.")



2. LAYOUT
    - Bad layout design - Wikipedia website (length of each line is so long)
    - Good layout design - Grammarly website 



3. ALIGNMENT
    - how you position each of the elements on the screen relative to each other
        - e.g.
            - Bad alignment - center-aligned HEADING but left-aligned BODY text
            - Good alignment - both left-aligned HEADING and BODY TEXT
    - just reduce the number of alignment points (looks a lot more professional)



4. WHITESPACE
    - refers to the empty spaces around texts altogether
    - just by adding whitespaces, you can make that design a lot more minimalist or elevated



5. AUDIENCE
    - design for your audience
    - think about your audience, think about what appeals to them and what's important to them 
    - e.g.
        - Bad design - Children's party invitation card - with black and white themed invitation card
        - Good design - Children's party invitation card - with colorful themed with party symbols invitation card



----------------------------------------------------------------
GOOD WEB DESIGN PRACTICE 
- use 30 - 40 characters per line
- both left-aligned HEADING and BODY TEXT or both center-aligned HEADING and BODY TEXT
- just reduce the number of alignment points (looks a lot more professional)
